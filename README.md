# Final-Project-Group3
This is the final project for the Machine Learning II class at the George Washington University. December, 2019

During the last couple of years, the focus of international development-oriented policies has slowly moved towards the environment. The increasing loss of area forest imposes a threat to biodiversity, contributes to climate change, habitat loss, and has many other devastating effects. Therefore, it is of crucial importance to analyze and understand these areas to be able to take action faster and more effectively. Being able to classify satellite images of the Amazon rainforest would help policy-makers in the region in the design of effective measures to fight deforestation.
